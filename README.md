devs: has anyone managed to use pagedown::chrome\_print() in a docker
container? I keep on getting “Failed to generate output in 30 seconds
(timeout).”

## The bug

The bug is that when run locally, everything works, but the problem is
that when the same is run in a docker container, the PDF fails to be
generated by `pagedown::chrome_print()`. This is caused by the Rmarkdown
template in `inst/app/www/Untitled.Rmd`. On line 17 the following
setting are specified in the chunk: `fig.width=30, fig.height=40`. If
this is removed, everything works in the docker container.

## Docker

Docker image built with:

`docker build -t golem.reprex .`

Docker image run with:

`docker run -it -p 3838:3838 golem.reprex`
